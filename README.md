🌍 **Country Navigator** 🌍

This is a simple and interactive web app that lets users explore countries worldwide. It fetches real-time country data, including the flag, capital, population, region, and subregion, using the REST Countries API.

API: REST Countries API
JavaScript Concepts Used:
async/await for fetching data

Template literals for dynamic HTML rendering

🚀 How It Works
Fetches country data on page load.
Displays each country’s flag, name, capital, population, region, and subregion in Bootstrap cards.
Users can search for a country by name, and the results update instantly.
If the API fails, an error message is displayed.
